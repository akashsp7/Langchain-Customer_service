"यह हार बहुत ही सुंदर है। यह मेरे द्वारा खरीदे गए सर्वश्रेष्ठ उपहारों में से एक है। केवल एक छोटा मुद्दा है, और वह है क्लैप्स। फिर भी, कुल मिलाकर यह एक शानदार खरीद है।",4,Deepak
I'm very pleased with this necklace. It's well-crafted and looks beautiful. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the delivery was a bit slow. But the product itself is fantastic!,4,Elenor
"The necklace is pretty, but it's more delicate than I expected. I'm worried it might break easily. It's nice for special occasions, but I wouldn't wear it every day.",3,Francis
"The necklace looks good, but the quality is average. The clasp feels a bit flimsy, and the chain is thinner than I thought it would be. It's okay for the price, but I was expecting a bit more.",3,George
"The necklace broke after just one week of wearing it. The chain snapped, and the pendant fell off. Very poor quality, especially considering the price. Would not recommend.",1,Hannah
"The necklace looks cheap and not as elegant as advertised. The stones don't shine much, and the overall appearance is underwhelming. I expected better quality for the price.",2,Ian
期待していたよりも品質が低かったです。チェーンがすぐに切れてしまい、ペンダントもあまり輝きません。価格に見合った価値がありません。残念です。,2,Jiro
