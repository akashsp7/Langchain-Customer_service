# Langchain Customer service

Automatically reply to customers and identify important tags in customer reviews.

## A good example
Here the system correctly identified tags like dainty and well-made as well as appropriately thanked the customer for its review in a natural manner.

## Translated example
Here, the original review was posted in Hindi and OP mentioned how there was a small issue with the clasps, thus earning the necklace 4 stars. The system acknowledged this issue in the tags as well as apologized for it.

## Bad Example
Here, as opposed to the previous case, the system did not record the tags in English, but in the original language of the review.
